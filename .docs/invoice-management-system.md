## Database Schema

### Invoices Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- invoice_number (Unique identifier, e.g., "MSDI 2588")
- invoice_date, due_date
- company_id (Foreign Key to companies - issuing company)
- invoice_to_id (Foreign Key to invoice_tos - recipient client)
- sub_total, tax_amount, discount_amount, balance, grand_total
- currency (default: KSH)
- status (draft|sent|paid|overdue|cancelled)
- notes, internal_notes
- payment details (paid_at, payment_method, payment_reference)
- timestamps, soft_deletes
```

### Invoice Items Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- invoice_id (Foreign Key to invoices)
- service_name, description, period
- quantity, unit, unit_price, line_total
- tax_rate, tax_amount
- discount_rate, discount_amount
- sort_order
- metadata (JSON)
- timestamps
```

### Invoice Tos (Clients) Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- company_name, company_address
- primary_phone, secondary_phone, email, website
- mpesa_account, mpesa_holder_name
- bank_name, bank_account, bank_holder_name
- additional_notes
- timestamps, soft_deletes
```

## Model Relationships

### Invoice Model
- `belongsTo(User::class)` - Invoice creator/owner
- `belongsTo(Company::class)` - Issuing company
- `belongsTo(InvoiceTo::class, 'invoice_to_id')` - Client/recipient
- `hasMany(InvoiceItem::class)` - Invoice line items

### InvoiceItem Model  
- `belongsTo(Invoice::class)` - Parent invoice

### InvoiceTo Model
- `belongsTo(User::class)` - Client record owner
- `hasMany(Invoice::class, 'invoice_to_id')` - Invoices sent to this client

## Key Business Logic

### Automatic Calculations
- **Line Item Totals**: `(quantity Ã— unit_price) - discount + tax`
- **Invoice Totals**: Automatically recalculated when items change
- **Tax Application**: Applied after discounts
- **Currency Formatting**: Consistent formatting across the system

### Invoice Status Workflow
1. **Draft** - Initial creation, editable
2. **Sent** - Issued to client, limited editing
3. **Paid** - Payment received and recorded
4. **Overdue** - Past due date without payment
5. **Cancelled** - Voided invoice

### Payment Tracking
- Multiple payment methods (MPESA, Bank Transfer, etc.)
- Payment reference/transaction ID storage
- Automatic status updates when paid
- Balance tracking for partial payments

## Livewire Component Architecture

### Main Component: `InvoiceManagement.php`
**Purpose**: Primary interface for invoice CRUD operations

**Key Properties**:
```php
public $invoices;           // Collection of user's invoices
public $selectedInvoice;    // Currently selected invoice for editing
public $clients;            // Available clients for selection
public $companies;          // User's companies
public $showModal = false;  // Modal visibility state
public $modalMode = 'create'; // create|edit|view
```

**Key Methods**:
- `mount()` - Initialize data and load user's invoices
- `createInvoice()` - Start new invoice creation
- `editInvoice($invoiceId)` - Load invoice for editing
- `viewInvoice($invoiceId)` - Display invoice details
- `saveInvoice()` - Save invoice (create/update)
- `deleteInvoice($invoiceId)` - Soft delete invoice
- `generatePDF($invoiceId)` - Generate invoice PDF
- `markAsPaid($invoiceId)` - Update invoice status to paid

### Sub-Component: `InvoiceForm.php`
**Purpose**: Invoice creation/editing form with line items

**Key Properties**:
```php
public $invoice;            // Invoice model instance
public $items = [];         // Array of invoice items
public $selectedClient;     // Selected client ID
public $newClient = [];     // New client data if creating
public $totals = [];        // Calculated totals
```

**Key Methods**:
- `addItem()` - Add new line item
- `removeItem($index)` - Remove line item
- `updateTotals()` - Recalculate all totals
- `saveInvoice()` - Validate and save complete invoice
- `selectClient($clientId)` - Load client data
- `createNewClient()` - Create client and associate

### Sub-Component: `ClientManagement.php`
**Purpose**: Manage invoice recipients/clients

**Key Properties**:
```php
public $clients;            // User's clients
public $selectedClient;     // Client being edited
public $showClientModal = false;
public $clientForm = [];    // Client form data
```

**Key Methods**:
- `createClient()` - Create new client
- `editClient($clientId)` - Edit existing client
